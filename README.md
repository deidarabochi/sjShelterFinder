# sjShelterFinder
An altered version of BobaUp!, an iOS app which can be found here: https://github.com/patrickwu2020/Boba-Up
The app takes your current location to find the nearest emergency shelter available in San Jose, the distance you are from your current location, and the address, phone number, and rating of the shelter.
